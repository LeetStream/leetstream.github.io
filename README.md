# LeetStream

## What is LeetStream?

LeetStream is a static website designed to help users improve their coding skills through daily practice with *LeetCode* problems. The website offers a curated selection of **220 problems** categorized into **26 coding patterns**, including sliding window, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and more. Each day, users are presented with the same *LeetCode* problem, shuffled to ensure spaced repetition across different coding patterns. By solving these problems and submitting their data, users can track their progress and identify areas for improvement.

## How to Use?

Using LeetStream is simple:

1. **Create or Join a Stream**: **First**, create a stream by providing a title, start date, stream rate (problems/day), and a discussion group URL (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord). Share this link with friends or a study group to solve problems together. **Second**, join the stream, you created or that was shared via the shared URL.
1. **Solve the Daily Problem**: Each day, you'll be presented with a LeetCode problem categorized under one of the 26 coding patterns. Solve the problem to the best of your ability. **Remember, once the day is over, you won't be able to revisit or solve the problem again, so make it a habit to solve it daily.**
1. **Submit Data**: After solving the problem, submit your data to calculate your score. Include information such as bugs encountered, hints used, time taken, and the type of solution (optimal, sub-optimal, brute force, ...).
1. **Review Results**: Once you've submitted your data, review your score. You can download a **CSV file** containing your scores to further analyze your performance using spreadsheet programs. This file will help you gain deeper insights into your strengths and areas for improvement.
1. **Access Study Material**: Explore links to articles and videos related to the coding patterns present in the problem you just solved. Use this material to deepen your understanding and improve your skills.
1. **Repeat Daily**: Come back each day to tackle a new problem, track your progress, and continue learning. Remember, consistency is key, as you won't have another chance to solve missed problems.

## Security and Privacy

LeetStream prioritizes the security and privacy of its users. The website is a static site, and user data is stored locally in the browser's local storage. This means that your data remains safe and private, accessible only to you on the device where you are using LeetStream. We do not collect any personally identifiable information or store user data on external servers, ensuring your privacy is maintained.
